# AutoPoint

AutoPoint is a project designed to automatically answer turning point questions. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kappavi/autopoint.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd autopoint
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

## Notes

Right now, you need to hardcode the answer choice positions in `answer_positions` in `select_answer`. Figure out the coordinates for your answer choices and put them there.
